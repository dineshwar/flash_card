# Flash Card

Flashcards are study tools typically made up of cards with information on two sides. One side usually has a question or term, and the other side has the answer or definition. They are used to help people memorize things by testing themselves. They are common for studying vocabulary, historical dates, formulas, or any subject matter that can be learned in a question-and-answer format. Flashcards can be physical cards you write on yourself, or digital flashcards on a computer or phone app.
